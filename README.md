# spring-security-demo
Demo of Spring Security with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, JPA, and H2 embedded database.

NOTE: I recently discovered that this demo does not run on my MacBook Pro for reasons I do not understand yet.  It does however work just fine on a Windows machine. 05 Jun 2019

## Things to note in this demo:

* The top nav displays either Login or Logout and the username depending whether or not there is currently a user who authenticated successfully.
* The addition of the Admin item in the navigation, if the user has the admin role.
